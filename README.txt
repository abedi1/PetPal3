Welcome to PetPal - a Tinder-style app designed to connect pet-owners in need of assistance with pet-lovers who can help
  Developed in Fall 2022 by Aman Bedi, Etna Ozkara, Annie Rhoades, and Tim McGarry
  
(i) why?
  We created PetPal for a class project - CS370 at Emory University. 
  The idea for this app was born out of two main philosophies: 
    -the swiping aspect of Tinder is really fun
    -people who need help taking care of their pets could use a place to connect with others who are interested and available.
  We decided to combine these thoughts into an app where pet-owners can ask for help with their pets, and people who want to take care of pets can
  actually find animals to take care of. 
  
  We know that it can be hard to find someone to help out with your pet, and we know that there are a lot of people out there who love
  playing with animals, so we created PetPal as a fun way to connect these markets. 
  
(ii) how the technology is architected and organized, including main technologies, 

(iii) what steps someone would need to take to set it up (ala README)
  
  
  Once the app is set up, users follow these steps:
    1. create an account
    2. once you sign in, you will be led to the profile creation page
      -if you are a PET OWNER and want help with your pet, create a profile FOR YOUR PET
          -include a picture of the pet, their name, and a little bio of info about them
        -choose the picker option that you want to see "People to take care of my pet"
        (this allows potential pet-sitters to see your pet's profile and allows you to see those potential pet-sitters' profiles)
      -if you are a potential PET SITTER and want to help with someone else's pet, create a profile FOR YOURSELF
          -include a picture of yourself, your name, and a little bio about you
         -choose the picker option that you want to see "Pets to take care of"
         (this allows pet owners to see your profile and allows you to see pets who need taking care of)
     3. SAVE your profile
     4. after that, get to swiping
        -when you swipe right on someone and they swipe right on you, you will see the other profile pop up in your "New Matches" screen
          where you can message them
    
    -if you need help on the swiping page, press the "?" button
